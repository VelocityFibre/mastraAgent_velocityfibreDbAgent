## 🎨 Development Approach

### BMAD Methodology Applied

**✅ Phase 1: Agentic Planning (Complete)**
- Analyst Agent → Analyzed current state
- PM Agent → Created requirements
- Architect Agent → Designed solution

**➡️ Phase 2: Context-Engineered Development (Next)**
- Scrum Master Agent → Breaking into tasks
- Developer Agent → Implementing features
- QA Agent → Testing & validation

### Why BMAD?

1. **Comprehensive Context** - Every story has full architectural context
2. **No Ambiguity** - Detailed specs prevent misunderstandings
3. **Consistent Quality** - Architecture enforced at story level
4. **Faster Development** - Less back-and-forth, clearer requirements
5. **Better Testing** - Test cases defined upfront
